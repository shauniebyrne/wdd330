   <h2>HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World (Sitepoint)</h2>
   <h3>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>CSS3 creation now allows one to tilt, scale, move, and flip elements without JS or JPEG</li>
    <li>css transform: how you manipulate an element's appearance</li>
    <li>Translation: allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down</li>
    <li>Written as transform: translate(x,y) (ex. transform: translate(45px, -45px);) - similar to position:relative but is correlated with its current position and doesn't impact the flow of the document</li>
    <li>Use transform: translateX(_px); to move only horizontally (left/right</li>
    <li>Use transform: translateY(_px); to move only vertically (up/down)</li>
    <li>Scaling: changes the size of an element</li>
    <li>Written as transform: scale(x,y); - factors are first horizontal than vertical, if only one value is given, it will change both x and y that amount.
        scale(1) will stay the same, scale(2) will double size, scale(0.5) will half the size, different x and y values will distort the element
    </li>
    <li>Can also use transform: scaleX(x); and transform: scaleY(y); just like transform</li>
    <li>Trasnform does not work on inline elements, change them to display: inline-block;</li>
    <li>Scale elements grow outwards from or shrink inwards from its center</li>
    <li>Always put all different functions in the same transform element or they will override each other (ex. transform: translateX(45px) scale(1.5);)</li>
    <li>Scaling has no impact on document flow, if you find your transform element blocking other elements, use font-size instead (this increases or decreases
        the size of the element and moves the other words around it.
    </li>
    <li>Rotation: rotates an element around the point of origin by a specific angle value</li>
    <li>Written transform: rotate(_) - degrees (deg): a positive degree rotates clockwise, a negative degree moves counterclockwise (ex. transform: rotate(10deg);)</li>
    <li>Slew: skews element along the x and y axis (ex. transfrom: skew(15deg, 4deg);)</li>
    <li>Transform-origin: changes an elements center point (ex transform-origin: 10% 10%;)</li>
    <li>REMEMBER: the order of transform functions makes a difference</li>
    <li>Transitions using CSS appear smoother and require less client-side processing which is great on mobile devices</li>
    <li>Transitions: allow the value of CSS properties to change over time, thus providding simple animations</li>
    <li>-webkit-: is needed for older mobie devices (such as iOS6.1, BlackBerry10, Android 4.3, and UC Browser for Android) (ex. -webkit-transform: translate(45px, 45px);)</li>
    <li>transition-property: defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned</li>
    <li>Any property changing from one value to another for which you can find a valid midpoint can be transitioned</li>
    <li>transition-property will not work on its own, it needs the duration as well (transition-duration)</li>
    <li>transition-duration: sets how long the transition will take; set in seconds (s) or miliseconds(ms)</li>
    <li>0.2s or 200ms is considered optimum time for a transtition duration</li>
    <li>transition-timing-function: lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail</li>
    <li>Describe your own timing function more precisely by defining your own cubi-bezier function (ex. cubic-bezier(0,0,1,1) = linear).</li>
    <li>transition-delay: introduces a delay before the transition begins (default is 0 or beginning right away); measured in seconds(s) or miliseconds(ms)</li>
    <li>transition: shorthand that combines all different transition properties into one line</li>
    <li>Animation: allow you to control each step of the animation via keyframes (whereas transitions just control change over time (no middle control))</li>
    <li>Keyframe: snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition; from and to (0% to 100%)</li>
    <li>make a keyframe by using @keyframes then name it (ex. @keyframes appearDisapper) </li>
    <li>Animation uses mostly the same porperties as transitions (animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, 
        animation-delay, animation-fill-mode, animation-play-state, animation(shorthand)</li>
    <li>Remember: that just because you can does't mean you should. Just use tranform, transitions, and animations when it will enhance the website, not just because</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This was  FASCINATING to me. I have seen this coding before but am excited to now understand what it all means!!!!!</p>
   <h3>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Canvas API: used to draw through JavaScript; this improves the performance of websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network</li>
    <li>Can draw shapes, lines, arcs, text, gradients, patterns, and manipulate pixels in images and videos</li>
    <li>Use Canvas in JS by using but must first put it in HTML by using <canvas></canvas> - what is put in the middle only shows if canvas isn't supported</li>
    <li>Set Canvas width and height in HTML not CSS (default is 300 by 150)</li>
    <li>Context is where your drawing is rendered</li>
    <li>WebGL does 3D but it is not widely supported yet</li>
    <li>In Canvas, the top left corner is 0,0 (x moves horizontally, y moves vertically)</li>
    <li>SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics</li>
    <li>SVG: a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML (vector graphics hold their quality even if they are blown up or shrunk down)</li>
    <li>Can draw paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns</li>
    <li>XML: eXtensible Markup Language; a markup metalanguage; a system meant to annotate text</li>
    <li>Images created with SVG are available via the DOM; unlike canvas</li>
    <li>Drawing a circle in SVG is arguably easier than in canvas</li>
    <li>SVG can get very complicated!!</li>
    <li>When is it better to use Canvas or SVG? It depends on what you're doing</li>
    <li>Canvas is faster and generally the better choice if youre loking to design a game requiring lots of animations</li>
    <li>SVG is accessible via the DOM, has a more complete set of tools to work with, but you can't manipulate SVG images the way you can manipulate pixels on canvas</li>
    <li>Drag and Drop API: allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page</li>
    <li>2 majo kinds of functionality: dragging files from your computer into a web page or dragging elements into other elements on the same page</li>
    <li>Draggable is not a Boolean so you must set it to true</li>
   </ul>
