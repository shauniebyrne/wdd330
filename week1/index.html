    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Doing Stuff With Web Things Study Book</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Took forever to get this up and running. Finally it 
            worked like it should and I have it downloaded. Then I couldn't 
            find the relevant info.
        </li>
        <li>Learned that key-value pairs, which is what is used in LocalStorage,
            are also used in many other places - like phone books, music,
            and grade books.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Master Mobile UX Videos</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reiterated the importance of writing code/pages for small screens first and
            then moving to the bigger (phone, to laptop, to computer).
        </li>
        <li>I thought the fact that users don't usually know what they want until you show them
            or tell them very interesting
        </li>
        <li>Also learned that it is important to make things work on the phone so that a person can use it
            with only one hand.
        </li>
        <li>There are three steps to help users: 1. Be There, 2. Be Useful, and 3. Be Quick</li>
        <li>There are four ways to increase the speed of your website: 1. reduce image usage throughout sites/apps, 2.
            SVG/Webfonts are lower brandwidth, 3. Optimize and Minify CSS/JS files, and 4. GZIP files to eliminate
            unnecessary data.
        </li>
        <li>Because of phones, the placement of the menu is proven to not work at the top, instead put it at the bottom
            within easy reach of the thumb. Also put frequently used menu items at the bottom. Easy, reachable things
            make a website seem faster.
        </li>
        <li>Interesting: not all users know what the hamburger button does even though everyone has seen one. Use the words
            "Menu" in a box instead. Also, that it is always a good idea to test/do research with anything you thing users
            would like just to make sure they actually would like it.
        </li>
        <li>Reminded to make forms as simple as possible and as easy to fill out as possible. Don't ask for info that is not
            needed and comments are best left for specific purposes.
        </li>
        <li>Interesting: make passwords actually show them and have the option for the user to pick to hide it. Also, you
            can create single line credit card forms, just make sure you space out the numbers. Lastly, link phone numbers
            on websites so that users can easily phone the company with any problems.
        </li>
    </ul>
