   <h3>Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Googles home page is a form and most of us use fors everyday to log into sites</li>
    <li>Form element is how you start a form</li>
    <li>Traditionally a form was created in front end and processesc using backend, but JS can process a form before it is sent to a server</li>
    <li>document.form accesses all of the forms in html in the order they appear; use it by going const form = document.forms[0]; to access the first form
        This is equivalent to const form = document.getElementByTagname('form')[0];
        OR access the form using the name of the form const form = document.forms['search']; search is the name of the form (form name='search')
    </li>
    <li>Access the forms element by calling their names, ex. const input = form['searchInput'] (searchInput is the name='' of the input field</li>
    <li>Finally figured out what focusing an element in a form does: places the curser line in the element box when clicked</li>
    <li>Change event and blur event work around each other. If a change occurs in the element, the change event is used, if a different element is clicked without making
        changes to the first element, the blur event is used.
    </li>
    <li>Possibly the most important form event is the submit event.</li>
    <li>If you use the dot method to call a form, you don't need a bunch of classes or ids (ex. const form = documents.forms['search']; search is the forms name</li>
    <li>Forms input fields (most common types of form control) include text, passwords,check boxes, radio buttons, file uploads (I love that they validate automatically for us)</li>
    <li>Forms select menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
    <li>Forms textarea elements are for longer test entries</li>
    <li>Forms button elements are for submitting and resetting forms</li>
    <li>Like using placeholders so the user knows what to expect when filling out the input field</li>
    <li>With input, text is the default so you don't necessarily have to add type='text' but it is recommended to do so anyway to make things clear</li>
    <li>With input, the value attribute presets the initial value of the field</li>
    <li>Check boxes are used when you want the user to be able to pick more than one option</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: check boxes and radio buttons need to have inputs all with the same name so that they all connect to each other  and both need to have their values set</li>
    <li>When using JS, check boxes are iterated over usinG a for loop and are boolean properties (true if checked, false if not checked)</li>
    <li>Radio buttons are used when you want the user choose only one choice (usually used with only 5 choices or less)</li>
    <li>Data in a hidden filed (type='hidden') isn't secret (visible in HTML) but rather the 'value' is submitted with the form but not displayed by the browser.
        Are often used to send info. such as settings or info. that the user has alread provided.
    </li>
    <li>Select drop down lists can be used to select from a number of options. 
        The 'multiple' attribute is required if more than one option is to be selected
    </li>
    <li>Set the value of a textarea by putting what you want said between the opening and closing tags</li>
    <li>The default type for a button is submit</li>
    <li>Type='reset' resets the form to their initial settings. Use wisely because the user could accidentaly press this and then have to start all over again</li>
    <li>Type='button' can be used outside of a form and simply just makes a clickable button that can have an addEventListener attached to it</li>
    <li>It is important to validate using JS and the built in validation. HTML5 has its own validation API. Use this by adding 'required' to all fields that must be filled in</li>
    <li>Disabling the submit button makes it so users can't submit a form without first filling in all required fields correctly</li>
    <li>Forms are primary method for entering data into a browser</li>
