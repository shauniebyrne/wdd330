   <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>
   <h2>Please Note: Any practice I did is found above. I was able to balance my time between reading and practice this week. </h2> 
   <h2>Question I have: Why is the libraries not working in VS Code??</h2>
   <h2>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja (Sitepoint)</h2>
   <h3>Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Googles home page is a form and most of us use fors everyday to log into sites</li>
    <li>Form element is how you start a form</li>
    <li>Traditionally a form was created in front end and processesc using backend, but JS can process a form before it is sent to a server</li>
    <li>document.form accesses all of the forms in html in the order they appear; use it by going const form = document.forms[0]; to access the first form
        This is equivalent to const form = document.getElementByTagname('form')[0];
        OR access the form using the name of the form const form = document.forms['search']; search is the name of the form (form name='search')
    </li>
    <li>Access the forms element by calling their names, ex. const input = form['searchInput'] (searchInput is the name='' of the input field</li>
    <li>Finally figured out what focusing an element in a form does: places the curser line in the element box when clicked</li>
    <li>Change event and blur event work around each other. If a change occurs in the element, the change event is used, if a different element is clicked without making
        changes to the first element, the blur event is used.
    </li>
    <li>Possibly the most important form event is the submit event.</li>
    <li>If you use the dot method to call a form, you don't need a bunch of classes or ids (ex. const form = documents.forms['search']; search is the forms name</li>
    <li>Forms input fields (most common types of form control) include text, passwords,check boxes, radio buttons, file uploads (I love that they validate automatically for us)</li>
    <li>Forms select menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
    <li>Forms textarea elements are for longer test entries</li>
    <li>Forms button elements are for submitting and resetting forms</li>
    <li>Like using placeholders so the user knows what to expect when filling out the input field</li>
    <li>With input, text is the default so you don't necessarily have to add type='text' but it is recommended to do so anyway to make things clear</li>
    <li>With input, the value attribute presets the initial value of the field</li>
    <li>Check boxes are used when you want the user to be able to pick more than one option</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: check boxes and radio buttons need to have inputs all with the same name so that they all connect to each other  and both need to have their values set</li>
    <li>When using JS, check boxes are iterated over usinG a for loop and are boolean properties (true if checked, false if not checked)</li>
    <li>Radio buttons are used when you want the user choose only one choice (usually used with only 5 choices or less)</li>
    <li>Data in a hidden filed (type='hidden') isn't secret (visible in HTML) but rather the 'value' is submitted with the form but not displayed by the browser.
        Are often used to send info. such as settings or info. that the user has alread provided.
    </li>
    <li>Select drop down lists can be used to select from a number of options. 
        The 'multiple' attribute is required if more than one option is to be selected
    </li>
    <li>Set the value of a textarea by putting what you want said between the opening and closing tags</li>
    <li>The default type for a button is submit</li>
    <li>Type='reset' resets the form to their initial settings. Use wisely because the user could accidentaly press this and then have to start all over again</li>
    <li>Type='button' can be used outside of a form and simply just makes a clickable button that can have an addEventListener attached to it</li>
    <li>It is important to validate using JS and the built in validation. HTML5 has its own validation API. Use this by adding 'required' to all fields that must be filled in</li>
    <li>Disabling the submit button makes it so users can't submit a form without first filling in all required fields correctly</li>
    <li>Forms are primary method for entering data into a browser</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>OOP: Obect-Oriented Programming</li>
    <li>OOP is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properites and methods</li>
    <li>I can see why we were required to do programming classes as well because this process of JS codes just like Python (with a few coding differeneces)</li>
    <li>Three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance</li>
    <li>Encapsulation: inner workings are hidden in an object and only the essentia; functionalities are exposed to the end user (such as the on button in a juicer - juicer just works, we don't know how)
        <br>Basically, this is keeping data private to protect it
    </li>
    <li>Polymorphism: same process can be used for different objects (many machines have an on button just like the juicer). This means that various objects can share the same method, while also being able
        make changes so they work specifically for that object
    </li>
    <li>Inheritance: taking the features of one object and then adding some new features (like getting a newer version of your juicer). This means we take an object that already exists, inherit all its
        properties and methods and then improve them by adding new properties and methods.
    </li>
    <li>JS now uses classes (I first learned how to use classes in my Programming class thorugh Python)</li>
    <li>Class: a blueprint for an object; objects are created as instances of the class and inherit the properties and methods (juicer class would represent the design of the juicer and each juicer thats made
        on the production line would be the instances of that class)
    </li>
    <li>Parenthesis are not required when creating a new object using a constructor function.
        Example, const redDice = new Dice;
        It is needed however if there is a parameter needed with the function.
    </li>
    <li>Class declaration syntax can now be used in JS; you create a class just like in Python (class Classname (must be capitalized) {}</li>
    <li>When a function is associated with a class or object, it is called a method. When an object is created from a class, it is called an instance of the class.</li>
    <li>All objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that created it.</li>
    <li>Use the 'prototype' property if you don't have access to the class declaration, but still want to add properties and methods to the class</li>
    <li>Use the 'prototype' property in your own code to add any new properties or methods after the class has been declared.
        Also, should be used to define any properties that will remain the same for every instance of the class.
    </li>
    <li>**Never use arrays or ojbects as a default value in prototype!!**</li>
    <li>**Just like in Python, make properties and methods private in a class by using the underscore before naming the property (ex. let _color = color;)</li>
    <li>Properties of objects in JS are said to be enumerable or non-enumberable (will not show up in a for-in loop)</li>
    <li>All properties and methods that are created by assignment are enumerable</li>
    <li>Good practice is for all built-in methods to be non-enumerable, adn any user-defined methods to be made enumerabel</li>
    <li>A class can inherit from another class using the 'extends' keyworkd in a class declaration.</li>
    <li>The toString() method is a good demonstration of polymorphism, since dirrerent objects have the same method but use it differently</li>
    <li>Monkey-patching is adding more methods to prototypes of JS built-in-objects</li>
    <li>Difference between shallow copies and hard copies, shallow copies change the original, hard copies make a whole new copy and therefore leave the original alone</li>
    <li>Factory functions: a function that can be used to return an object</li>
    <li>Gorilla Banana Problem: problem with inheriting classes, you get the whole class rathar than just the method you want.</li>
    <li>If you do use classes in JS, it is recommended that you make them 'skinny' (they don't have too many properties and methods)</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Chapter 15: Modern Javascript</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>JQuery is the most popular of all the JS libraries</li>
    <li>For instance, classList isn't supported in older versions but addClass() in JQuery is accepted in all versions</li>
    <li>$ symbon is associated with the global jQuery and contains all of its methods</li>
    <li>Underscore and Lodash are similar libraries (ex. _.flatten[])</li>
    <li>Some believe Libraries should not be used, it is known that just JS runs code faster than using Libraries</li>
    <li>However, Libraries save time when you have a big project with a large team</li>
    <li>**Remeber: when using Libraries, they can fall out of favor and discontinue at any time, then your program wont work</li>
    <li>Monolithic: Libraries that have a plethora of methods that try to do everything. Ex. jQuery</li>
    <li>Should only use Libraries to speed up JS developemnt by making it easier to complete common tasks, not because you don't understand JS</li>
    <li>Module: a self-contained pice of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules</li>
    <li>Module tips: code in modules are in strict mode, module is its own global scope - variables created in the module will only work within it, top value of this is undefined instead of the global object, can't use HTML style comments in modules</li>
    <li>If you want to import the whole module use the * (ex. import * as stats from './stats.js';)</li>
    <li>Defualt Exports: refer to a single variable, function, or class in a module that can be imported without having to be explicitly named</li>
    <li>Having more than one default export will cause a syntax error</li>
    <li>MVC: Model-View-Controller</li>
    <li>MVC seperates an application into three components: models, views, and controllers</li>
    <li>Models: objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting specific pieces of info about the application</li>
    <li>Views: provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant info</li>
    <li>Controllers: link models and views together by communicating between them</li>
    <li>Templating languages make code between JS and HTML easy</li>
    <li>React is JS library created by Facebook and is used by BBC, PayPal, and Netflix</li>
    <li>Reconciliation: DOM only updated when changes are made</li>
    <li>Package: a directory with one or more files of code</li>
    <li>npm: Node Package Manager</li>
    <li>CDNs: Content Delivery Networks</li>
    <li>Minification: process of removing any unnecessary characters from JS code to reduce file size (like whitespace, comments, and other characters).</li>
    <li>Code Obfuscation: minifiers change the variable and functoins names to single letters making the JS file more difficult to read.</li>
    <li>Rule of thumb: use well-commented and descriptive code in development and minified code in production.</li>
    <li></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Class Practice Example: Look at Console because this is all done in JS<script src="../week4/practice/ch12_ch15_js_practice.js"></script></p>
