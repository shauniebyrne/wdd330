   <h1>Week 3 Notes</h1>
   <h2>Please Note: </h2> 
   <h2>Object Methods: this</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Method: functions that are stored in object properties</li>
    <li>OOP: Object-Oriented Programming</li>
    <li>To access the object, a method can use the "this" keyword</li>
    <li>Use "this" instead of just referencing the outer variable (name of the object) is to avoid errors </li>
    <li>"This" is "free": can be used for multiple different objects when a function is called. By using "this",
        you can use functions like they are meant to be used, not just for one object at a time, but many.
    </li>
    <li>Arrow functions don't have their own "this"; they take info from the outer "normal" function</li>
    <li>The value of "this" is defined at run time</li>
    <li>Ladder object allows you to do up and down with numbers</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>This in JavaScript</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>"this" in a global context defaults to the window ojbect, but this isn't usually used</li>
    <li>"this" in an ojbect construction refers to the instance, but only when calling the function with "new" 
        (ex. function Person(age) { this.age = age; } const greg = new Person(22);</li>
    <li>Use "bind" to use "this" to reference the object in an event listener</li>
    <li>"bind" doesn't work with arrow functions</li>
    <li>"this" is a crucial keyword in JavaScript</li>    
   </ul>
